These are notes and code snippets from the Udemy Workshop https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/[Understanding TypeScript]. Although this repository here uses code snippets from the Udemy Workshop, the original course is very much recommended.

== Introduction
* = superset of Java Script, which is a new statically, strongly-typed programming language on top of Java Script
* doesn't run in the browser, has to be compiled - that's what the CLI is for!
* type can either be stated explicitly:

    serverId:number = 10;

* type can also be omitted and chosen automatically:

    serverId = 10;

* with Ctrl + B, variables reveal their types:

* ES6 also brings types, but not yet supported by all browsers

== Installation
1. https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm[install NPM]
1. install TypeScript via

[source, terminal]
----
npm -g install typescript
----

== Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
1. navigate to where your ts file is located
1. compile with filename without ".ts", so for example to compile _script.ts_, do:

[source, terminal]
----
tsc script
----

== Setup for this workshop
* put project folder under control of NPM:
[source, terminal]
----
npm init
----
* will create a package.json
* install lite-server:
[source, terminal]
----
npm install lite-server --save-dev
----
* add script to start server (in _package.json_):
[source, terminal]
----
"scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "lite-server"
----
* start server with
[source, terminal]
----
npm start
----
* server will automatically react on changes in the codebase
* application on localhost:3000
* make folder managed by TypeScript with
[source, terminal]
----
tsc --init
----
* will create a _tsconfig.json_-file
* that way, all TypeScript files will be compiled with only
[source, terminal]
----
tsc
----
* attention: keep lite-server running in different terminal-tab!



== Features

=== Automatic Creation of Properties
* instead of writing this:

[source]
----
export class Ingredient {
    public name: string;
    public amount: number;

    constructor(name: string, amount: number) {
      this.name = name;
      this.amount = amount;
    }
  }
----

* ... this can be written with the same result:
[source]
----
export class Ingredient {

  constructor(public name: string, public amount: number) {
  }
}
----
* properties will be automatically created and assigned with the parameters of the constructor

=== Variable Declaration: var, let, const
* three options for declaring variable: var, let, const

==== var
* spoiler alert: least preferable from the three options
* traditional the way to declare a variable in JavaScript
* available in TypeScript because TypeScript = superset of JavaScript
* some odd "features" like "var-scoping": declarations of var are accessible anywhere, even globally. Details see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/variable-declarations.html[here]

==== let
* introduced because of the problems with var
* block-scoped = not visible outside of the block let was defined in
* behavior = expected behavior when coming from Java

==== const
* = augmentation of let; prevents re-assignment
* principle of least privilege: const should be used whenever re-assignment of variable is not intended
